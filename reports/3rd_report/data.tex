\section{data}
For our task we were given a set of 8465 student course enrollment data. That is authentic data from the computer science students at the University of Helsinki. It covers the years 1995 â€“ 2012. 

The courses a student had enrolled for were given as sequences of sets. The student data of a particular student is shown below. Each set within { } brackets represents a teaching period and the sequence indicates an order of the teaching period. 

{ advanced_wireless_communication_systems internet_protocols }
{ advance_registration_for_seminars epoc_architecture_and_programming }
{ advance_registration_for_seminars introduction_to_specification_and_verification }
{ advance_registration_for_seminars petri_nets }
{ performance_analysis advanced_networking }
{ performance_analysis }
{ advance_registration_for_seminars }
{ nodes_research_seminar2006 }

Further information, such as year the course was held in,  course level and its compulsory status about most of the courses was also available. In our evaluation we only consider a subset of courses for which this additional information is available.
