\section{Data}


For our task we were given a set of 8465 student course enrollment data. 
That is authentic data from the computer science students at the University of Helsinki. 
It covers the years 1995 â€“ 2012.

The courses a student had enrolled for were given as sequences of sets. 
The student data of a particular student is shown below. 
Each set within { } brackets represents a teaching period and the sequence indicates an order of the teaching period.

\textit{
\{ advanced\_wireless\_communication\_systems internet\_protocols \}
\{ advance\_registration\_for\_seminars epoc\_architecture\_and\_programming \}
\{ advance\_registration\_for\_seminars introduction\_to\_specification\_and\_verification \}
\{ advance\_registration\_for\_seminars petri\_nets \}
\{ performance\_analysis advanced\_networking \}
\{ performance\_analysis \}
\{ advance\_registration\_for\_seminars \}
\{ nodes\_research\_seminar2006 \}
}



Further information, such as year the course was held in,  course level and its compulsory status about most of the courses was also available. In our evaluation we only consider a subset of courses for which this additional information is available.
