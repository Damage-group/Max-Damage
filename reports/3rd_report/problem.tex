\section{Problem}

The courses taken by computer science students at the University of Helsinki will reflect study patters of groups of students in some way or another.
Those might either occur due to strict study requirements or due to similar choices of students. We are more interested in the patters stemming form the latter option, the free choice.

Knowledge about such patterns might help scheduling and adjusting those courses or help guiding future generations in their choices.

For this task, we were given a set of 8465 student course enrollment data. The courses a student had enrolled for, were given as a sequences of sets. Each set represented a teaching period, and the sequence showed the order of the teaching period.
