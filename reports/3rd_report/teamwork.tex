\section{Teamwork}
Frankly speaking, teamwork in this iteration could be better. We did not assign a team leader in this iteration and it really showed. Combined with the Easter break, general spring downbeat mood and the one-week full-day lab course more than half of the group members we found ourselves in the dire situation. Less than one week before the deadline we did only minor progress from the starting point apart from the coding done by Teemu. Luckily for us we had the main part of the implementation already done thanks to all the work done in the previous iterations. Last Thursday we had an extra meeting, which actually kick-started the work for this iteration. Contrary to the past fears the actual amount of work was not that great as it seemed before getting familiar with the problem. The bulk of work was done over the weekend and we had a working implementation by Monday. Getting meaningful results was another matter. A part of results arrived just in time for the poster, but more analysis was done after the Monday session producing additional results.\\

Lessons learned here. a) Having a lot of time is not necessarily a good thing from the efficiency point of view. b) Especially if it is stretched over Easter holiday. c) Spring is really demotivating for any school morale. d) Having a person who would organize teamwork and kick people around would be really beneficial.
