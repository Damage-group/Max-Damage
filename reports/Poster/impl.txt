Implemented sequence mining algorithm

* Candidate generation follows the instructions of the book.
	* Takes advantage of alphabetically ordering venets inside elements.
	* Prunes infrequent sequences based on contiguous {k-1}-seuqnces.
* Support counting uses subsequence detection in brute force manner.
* Subsequence detection is completely our own code.
