\section{Teamwork Evaluation}
Comparing to the last week we used IRC more often to communicate and delegate task samong the group members. All group members joined the github and took part in coding. Roughly half the group had problems with understanding the logic behind git, but this minor problem did not cause any show-stoppers in the end. As far as the measure methods are concerned, they need to be discussed more and an appropriate implementation will be chosen based on the provided data. This will be improved in the later problems. Overall our group worked more fluently in this iteration.
