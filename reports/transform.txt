Data Transformation and command line arguments.

Both the meta data in course_details.txt and actual FID data in course_num.txt were transformed.
Firstly, only courses with meta data information were taken into account and FID's not present in
course_details were omitted when reading course_num. Secondly all the courses were grouped 
to single entity by FID. 

Each so acquired course instance then had following attributes:
	FID - fid
	NAME - course name, lower case and slugified
	YEAR - sequence of years the course has been taught, i.e. [1999, 2000, 2004]
	SUBPROGRAM - subprogram of the course
	COMPULSORY - P:yes V:no ?:not known

The code and semester information were omitted because of they were thought to be non- relevant.
When the data was transformed it was easy to only take into account for example courses that are
compulsory, taught on certain year interval, etc. We also added some command line tools to restrict the courses. 

For example: 
> python prob2.py t=0.4 c=0.2 year=2006-2011 compulsory=V strip=2

would only look at the non-compulsory courses that were taught in years from 2006 to 2011 and 
after it would strip of all the transactions with 2 or less items.  In this case minimum support would be
0.4 and minimum confidence 0.2. The reason to apply these kind of restrictions is to look only 
subset of courses which might give more interesting results.
