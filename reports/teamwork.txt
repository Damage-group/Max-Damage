Comparison to last week, we ues IRC more often to communicate and the division of the task among the group more clear. All group members have joined the github and impletement some codes in the code version control platform. Our group work more fluently this turn. For this measure methods, we just need more discussion, choose some effectivemeasures for the specific available data and then implement them to avoid wasting time on implementatio of those consistant interestiness measures. We will improve in the later problems.
